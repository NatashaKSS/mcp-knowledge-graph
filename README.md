# Exploring MCP Knowledge Graph Servers

An MCP Server built with FastMCP w/ KuzuDB for embedded Cypher-backed knowledge graph storage.

This is purely for exploration purposes.

## Setup

1. Install `uv` (see [the doc site](https://docs.astral.sh/uv)), our Python package manager of choice. Here is a [quick start guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/) of `uv` that contains some basic features.
2. Prepare your virtual environment (`venv`) by running `uv run <script>.py`. Whenever this command is run, `uv` automatically installs the needed packages from the lockfile into your project environment and even creates it if it isn't already done so (see [the doc site about 'the project environment'](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/layout/#the-project-environment) for more info).
