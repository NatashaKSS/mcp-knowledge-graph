Given the following text content, extract semantic entities and relationships to build a Knowledge Graph representation:

**Text:** {text}

**Ontology (RDF Format):**
{ontology}

**IMPORTANT:** Only extract entities and relationships that are explicitly defined in the ontology above. Respect all ontological constraints including allowed entity types, relationship types, and domain/range restrictions specified in the RDF schema.

Give your response in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "EntityName",
      "properties": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "SourceEntityName",
      "target": "TargetEntityName", 
      "relation": "relationship_type",
      "properties": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

During your extraction process, follow these instructions as much as possible: 

### Dos:

1. **Extract ALL key entities, concepts, or actors** mentioned in the text that match the provided ontology
2. **Create comprehensive relationships** between all relevant entities based on the text content
3. **Use exact entity names** as they appear in the text for consistency
4. **Choose precise relationship types** from the ontology that accurately describe interactions
5. **Fill all required fields** for both entities and relationships
6. **Capture important details** as properties of entities or relationships when relevant
7. **Connect entities meaningfully** - ensure extracted entities relate to each other logically
8. **Follow ontological constraints** strictly - only use predefined entity types and relationship types
9. **Extract complete context** - include all entities that are central to understanding the text
10. **Use descriptive property values** that add meaningful information about entities and relationships
11. **Prioritize explicit information** found directly in the text over assumptions
12. **Create direct relationships** between entities when the text clearly indicates connections

### Don'ts:

1. **Don't extract entities or relationships** not defined in the provided ontology
2. **Don't create duplicate entities** - use consistent naming for the same entity across extractions
3. **Don't infer information** that isn't explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text
4. **Don't create overly complex structures** when simple relationships suffice
5. **Don't ignore ontological constraints** - always respect domain/range restrictions
6. **Don't create relationships without clear textual evidence** of the connection
7. **Don't use relationship types** not present in your ontology schema
8. **Don't extract trivial or irrelevant details** that don't contribute to knowledge representation
9. **Don't create isolated entities** without attempting to find meaningful connections
10. **Don't duplicate existing relationships** - focus on new information only
11. **Don't create intermediate entities** when direct relationships are more appropriate
12. **Don't violate cardinality constraints** or other restrictions specified in the ontology

**Important:** 
1. Always try to ensure a clear graph structure. 
Focus on capturing the essential knowledge from the text while strictly adhering to your ontological boundaries and constraints.
